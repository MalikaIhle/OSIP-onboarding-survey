# OSIP-onboarding-survey
Open Science Initiative in Psychology LMU Munich Onboarding survey

suggestion for improving the survey:
- for career: write PI/prof/lecturer/ass prof and add BSc
- for comments: do not make mandatory, or have multichoice: Yes No, and is Yes please specify.
- add cell to indicate email if want to be contacted about their possible contribution
- remove fading of colour when hovering (if possible?)
- in activities: separate seminars from workshops
